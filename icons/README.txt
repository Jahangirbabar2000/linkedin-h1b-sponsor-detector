ICON FILES NEEDED

Please add the following icon files to this directory:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple icons using any image editor, or use online icon generators.
The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder icon.

Suggested icon design:
- Use a simple design with "H1B" or visa/sponsorship related imagery
- Use colors that stand out (e.g., blue, green, or LinkedIn blue #0077b5)
- Ensure icons are clear at small sizes (especially 16x16)
